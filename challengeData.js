			"Physical activity, performed on a daily basis, has a positive cumulative effect on our mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. Developing healthy habits that help us feel and look better takes time and perseverance. The Daily Walk Challenge is a great way to decompress, clear your mind, help your body and develop a healthier approach to how you use your free time to improve your health both now and for the future. There is a lot of recent neurobiological research that shows that walking helps our brain work better and makes us a little bit smarter, but really what we should focus on is how we feel after a walk that's helped clear our brain and got our lungs working.",

			"Although our taste buds and our body are highly attuned to the pleasure derived from sugar, today there is sugar in many of our foodstuffs and way too much in our diet. This causes problems with our microbiome, it affects our weight and it impacts on our health. The No Sugar challenge helps you address this balance. Over a month, you help your taste buds reset, you aid in the recovery and resetting of your microbiome flora and discover just how much this small dietary change can affect your weight. You build up a new, healthier you by making small changes, one day at a time. This is a good start.  ",
